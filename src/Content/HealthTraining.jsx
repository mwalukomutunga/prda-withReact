                                            and Local Non-Government Organisations
                                            (NGOs) that were committed to the Main Objective of contributing to the
                                            reduction of the rampant Maternal and infant
                                            mortality rates in South Sudan and is still relevant.</p>
                                        <p>To mitigate this, the School trains quality midwives who after their
                                            graduation are well equipped with knowledge and
                                            skills to find employment in South Sudan and provide their services to the
                                            community.</p>

                                            Sudan. The School has adopted the new

                                            work-intensive and is divided into two thematic
                                            areas, theory and practical or hands-on-work. These two areas hone the

                                            level of Diploma in Midwifery that will take
                                            three years and are bound to complete their training by June 2019. The

                                            camp about 100km away. PRDA has expanded the size of their camp at Kakuma by
                                            acquiring more space adjacent to its base
                                            with a hope of developing it so as to provide sufficient accommodation,
                                            however, with limited funds this effort remains
                                            a challenge.</p>

                                        <p>The institution has indeed been undergoing many challenges in terms of
                                            limited funding despite the increase in the cost
                                            of living. To cope, the School has reduced the staff incentives by 10% and
                                            20%. And has also limited most of its
                                            expenses on construction and renovation but students feeding and training
                                            materials remain the same.</p>

                                            support for the next four years. The other Partner Uniting World (UW) of the

                                            substantially reduced their funding to the School and may want to move to
                                            supporting different activities related to
                                            Institutional development and capacity building.</p>
